You can select the lyrics source you prefer.

Genius: Offers the best quality lyrics, provides the most songs, and updates lyrics the fastest. Does not and will never be time-synced.

LRCLIB: The most open service, offering time-synced lyrics. However, it lacks lyrics for many songs.

Musixmatch: The service Spotify uses. Provides time-synced lyrics for many songs, but you'll need a user token to use this source.

Petit Lyrics: Has a large database of time-synced Japanese and international songs. Lacks several Western songs. 

If the tweak is unable to find a song or process the lyrics, you'll see a "Couldn't load the lyrics for this song" message. The lyrics might be wrong for some songs when using Genius due to how the tweak searches songs. I've made it work in most cases.
